# Workshop Slides

This directory contains the notebooks used to generate the slides. The HTML version of the slides can be found in the [`html/`](./html/) directory.  To generate a PDF version of the slides, use [this](https://stefmolin.github.io/pandas-workshop/slides/html/workshop.slides.html?print-pdf#/) link to view the slides (be patient &ndash; it may take a while to load), and then use `ctrl + P` or `cmd + P` to print to a PDF file.
